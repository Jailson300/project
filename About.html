  <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 30px;"><mark> MEITEI/MEETEI</mark></h2> 

  <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 20px;">The Meitei tribe, also known as the Manipuris, is an indigenous ethnic group primarily residing in the northeastern Indian state of Manipur. They are the dominant ethnic group in the state and have a profound cultural influence in the region. Here's a detailed look at the Meitei tribe:</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left; font-size: 25px;"><mark>HISTORY AND ORIGIN</mark></h2> 

  <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 20px;">The Meitei people have an ancient history with origins that can be traced back to pre-historic times. Their early history is preserved through oral traditions, ancient texts, and archaeological findings. The earliest records mention the presence of the Meitei civilization around 33 AD, although some sources suggest even earlier settlements.<br>
    The Meitei language, also known as Manipuri, is the lingua franca of Manipur and is recognized as one of the 22 scheduled languages of India. It belongs to the Tibeto-Burman language family and has its own script, known as Meitei Mayek, which has been revived and promoted in recent years.
</p>

<h2  style="text-align: left; font-size: 25px;" ><mark>CULTURE AND TRADITION</mark></h2> 

<p style="text-align: justify; font-size:20px;"><b>- Dance and Music:</b> Manipuri dance, a classical form of Indian dance, is renowned for its grace and spiritual depth. The traditional music of the Meiteis is equally significant, often involving instruments like the Pena, a traditional bowed lute.<br> 

<p style="text-align: justify; font-size:20px;"><b>- Handloom and Handicrafts:</b> The Meitei community is famous for their handloom weaving, producing exquisite fabrics like the Phanek (a traditional wrap-around skirt) and the Moirang Phee.<br> 

<p style="text-align: justify; font-size:20px;"><b>- Festivals:</b> he Meitei people celebrate numerous festivals, with Lai Haraoba being one of the most important. This festival involves elaborate rituals, dances, and songs dedicated to their traditional deities.<br> 

<p style="text-align: justify; font-size:20px;"><b>- Martial Arts:</b> Thang-Ta, the traditional martial art form of the Meiteis, combines combat techniques with spiritual and philosophical elements.</p><br> 
  

<h2 style="text-align: left; font-size: 25px;" ><mark>RELIGION AND SOCIETY</mark></h2> 
  <p style="font-size: 20px;">The religious practices of the Meitei people are a unique blend of Hinduism and their indigenous Sanamahi religion. While Hinduism, introduced in the 18th century, plays a significant role in their religious life, the traditional Sanamahi religion, which involves the worship of nature and ancestral spirits, remains deeply rooted in their culture.
 </p>
 <p style="font-size: 20px;">The Meitei society is structured around a 7-clan system, namely <mark>MANGANG, LUWANG, KHUMAN, ANGOM, MOILANG, KHAPA NGANPA, SALANG LEISANGTHEM,</mark>  with each clan tracing its lineage to a common ancestor. They have a strong sense of community and social cohesion, with traditional institutions and councils playing a crucial role in resolving disputes and maintaining social order.
</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left; font-size: 25px;" ><mark>CONTRIBUTION TO SPORTS AND ARTS</mark></h2>

 <br>
 <p style="font-size: 20px;">Manipuri dance, a classical dance form, is one of the major contributions of the Meitei tribe to Indian classical arts. This dance form is known for its grace, fluid movements, and spiritual expression. It has been performed and celebrated internationally.
